This repository contains supplementary files related to the methods used to analyze scRNA-seq data from the Sousa et al. paper, "The Immune Landscape of Murine Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Aging."

Disclaimer: The cellranger-web-summaries folder includes web summary files generated by the Cell Ranger tool, used to process sequencing data following the 10X Genomics protocol. Please note that there is a discrepancy between the file names and the names displayed in the web summaries, which resulted from an initial sample labeling mix-up by the sequencing company. Therefore, the file names should be considered correct, as they reflect the proper labeling.
